# Caesar-Cipher-Messaging
_________________________

This project creates a cipher-machine which can encrypt or decrypt a code in the language C. The program runs these five commands:
1. encrypt - Encrypt user’s input based on Caesar’s cipher.
2. decrypt - Decrypt user’s input based on Caesar’s cipher.
3. unary - Encode a number into a unary code.
4. encode - Encode user’s input reversed.
5. exit - Exit the program
